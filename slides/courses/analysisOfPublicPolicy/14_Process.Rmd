# Small-N Methods: Process-Tracing and Beyond

---

## Overview

### Process tracing
+ What's that?
+ Steps
+ Evidence

### SNA toolkit:

+ .gray[Case study]
+ .gray[Process tracing]
+ Interview
+ Focus group
+ Content analysis

## Process Tracing

What: "CSI"

--

Goal : Theory testing

Hypothesis: Explanation rivalry

## Example: English Recognition in Singapore

Why did English become a recognized official language in the Singaporean language policy?


Esp. given there were only 21% of the population spoke this language when the country was independent.

---

### Step 1: Identify Hypotheses

H<sub>0</sub>: State (institutional) capacity  
H<sub>1</sub>: Prioritization of the education ministry

???

Goh Keng Swee (吴庆瑞): 财政部长、内政及国防部长、副总理, 奠定了新加坡教育的精英主义政策, 取得伦敦政经学院经济学博士学位。

The Goh Report identified and set out recommendations to address three shortcomings: high education wastage, low literacy, and ineffective bilingualism. English was taught to maximize proficiency

### Step 2: Establish Time Line


???

1. The very second step right after determining the DV
1. Before the evidence collection

---

### Step 3: Construct Causal Graph

.center[<img src="images/causalEnglish.jpg" height = 500 />]

???

Causal process of X &rarr; Y  
Used to identify relevant moments and actors that could affect the results.

---

### Step 4: Identify Alternative Choice or Event
### Step 5: Identify Counterfactual Outcomes

Counterfactual 1: Weak State &rarr; language of the dominant population language.

Counterfactual 2: Leed did not assign Goh as the MOE &rarr; the status quo.

???

A reason that choices might make differences  
If there's no comparative cases, then conterfactual outcomes.

---

## Terminology

*Necessary* & *sufficient* conditions/statments

When A is a .magenta[sufficient] condition of B, then once A happens, B must happen.  
When A is a .magenta[necessary] condition of B, then there must be A for B to happen.

---

## Practice

+ Being 2, 4, 6, or 8 is _ for being an even number.
+ Being 2, 4, 6, or 8 is _ for being an even number <10.

--

+ Being highly intelligent is _ for being a student of Tsinghua.
+ Showing up to class is _ for getting an A.
+ Being mortal is _ for being human.
+ Being a rational animal is _ for being human.

*Let's back to process tracing*

### Step 6: Find Evidence for Primary Hypothesis

| .small[Necessity\\Sufficiency]<sup>&midast;</sup> | Yes             | No                |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Yes                   | Double-Decisive | Smoking Gun       |
| No                    | Hoop            | Straw-in-the-Wind |

???

1. Hoop test: no alibi, the accused in the state when murder happens? If not innocent, but passing does not mean being guilty.
1. Smoking-gun test: a smoking gun seen in a suspect's hand moments after a shooting is quite conclusive proof of guilt, but a suspect not seen with a smoking gun is not proven innocent.
1. Double-decisive test: hoop + smoking-gun, like a camera record
1. Straw-in-the-wind test: Richard Liu seemed friendly with the girl.

The primary hypothesis failed the hoop test: when recognition happened, the state was not a strong state

## Interview

.center[<img src="images/interview.jpg" height = 300 />]

### Procedure

Strategic communication (guiding and listening)

---

### How a Interview Processes

<video width="700" height="500" controls>
    <source src="images/interview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

???

Brexit: The Uncivil War  

Benedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings, main political strategist for Vote Leave, 

---

.left-column[
### Outcome: 
+ Open answers
+ Messy details
+ Contradictory points
]  

--

.right-co[
### Technique
+ Safe environment
+ More listening, less talking
+ Design the interview strategy + pilots
]

--

### Be Prepared...

class: small

## Focus Group

Procedure:

1. Size: 5--15
1. Subjects read or watch something.
1. Researcher ask the questions.
1. Subjects express the feelings and opinions.

Brexit: The Uncivil War  

Rory Kinnear as Craig Oliver, the former Director of Politics and Communications for British prime minister David Cameron

### Pros:

1. Real-life environment
1. Flexibility
1. Low cost


--

### Cons:

1. Non-privacy-protection
1. Who lead the talk?
1. No SUTVA
1. Selection interviewees

---

## Content analysis

.center[<img src="images/closeReading.jpg" height = 480 />]

---

## Step 1: Content Sampling

* Terminology:
    + Content analysis: 100 and below
    + Text analysis: above 100 (usually above 1,000)
    + Unit of analysis?

--
    
* Sampling technique
    + Convenient sample
    + Stratification
    + Clustering

---

## Step 2: Coding

* Manifest content
* Latent content
* Online assistance: [CATMA](http://catma.de/) or eMargin

---

## Example with CATMA

## Step 3 Analysis

Not much different from other interpretive methods

1. Context
1. Transparency
1. Transferability

]

---

### Pros

* Economic
* Allowing correction
* Overtime survey
* Third party

--

### Cons

* Limited content
* Limited scale
* Subjective consistency

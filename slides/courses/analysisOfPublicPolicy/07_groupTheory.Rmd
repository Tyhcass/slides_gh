## Madison's Pluralism

> .small[By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, .magenta[adversed] to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.   
--- Madison, *Federalist* #10]

???

"The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection," *Federalist*, No. 10

1. Remove the causes of faction
    + Destroying liberty
    + Creating a society homogeneous in opinions and interests

--

Faction and Prevent Faction (?)


---

## When Removing Is Inappropriate

Control "only working in a republic"

+ A large one (diverse interest groups)
+ Under federalism (making local matter)

???

The principle of popular sovereignty should prevent minority factions from gaining power.  
Not fit pure democracy, only the representatives can construct common interests

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._10#Madison's_arguments

---

## Bentley's Interest Group

+ Activity of a group
+ Expression of an interest
+ Exertion of pressure

???

Bentley, Arthur Fisher. 1908. *The Process of Government: A Study of Social Pressures*. Principia Press.

---

## Truman's Group Theory

Government Process: 

.magenta[Via] interest groups (Bentley) &rarr;  
.magenta[As] interactions of interest groups (Truman)

???

Truman, David B. 1951. *The Governmental Process: Political Interests and Public Opinion*. New York: Knopf.

The government plays an active role in establishing the conditions for interest groups to act.

---

## Truman's Interest Group

+ Politicized interest groups is government institutions. 
+ The interest groups' characteristics influence governmental decisions. 
+ Diversity makes policy-making flexible.

???

The interest groups' **strategic position** in the society (groups' status and prestige; their standing against the rules of the game; government membership in these groups; their usefulness as a source of information) and **internal characteristics** of both the interest groups (degree of organization; the skills of the leadership; and resources/money) and **governmental institutions** (operating structure; groups' effects on particular branches of the government) affect the influence on governmental decisions.  
The political structure of the U.S. government (federalism, liberty, rights) allows potential interest groups to rise and therefore play a role in representing interests.  
Diversity and will accommodate policy-making and will make it more flexible.

## Collective Action Problem: Free Rider

???

Everyone has an intention not to contribute

See also Garrett Hardin' s tragedy of the commons

a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.

## Olson's Solutions

### Size: .magenta[Small] is good

.center[<img src="images/lianZuo.jpg" height = 400 />]

???

+ Lower organization/transaction cost
+ Higher impact on individuals' cost
+ Larger per-capita benefit

---

### Privileged: Benefited groups work better

.center[<img src="images/deliverInsurance.png" height = 400 />]

???

+ Benefits are asymmetric
+ The most benefited party provides the public goods

---

### Selective Incentives

## Rereasoning Collective Action

*Critical Mass Theory* (Oliver & Marwell 1993)

Production functions determines the critical mass

+ Accelerating (bandwagon effects)
+ Decelerating (free-rider)
+ S-shape

???



---

## Introducing Institutions In

Institutional arrangement for collective actions (Ostrom 1990)

+ People are not autonomous
+ Rules can reduce collective action issues

???

Ostrom, Elinor. 1990. *Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action*. Cambridge University Press.

Other solutions

1. Critical mass theory

Marwell, Gerald, and Pamela Oliver. 1993. The Critical Mass in Collective Action. Cambridge University Press.

1. Each additional contribution has an increasing effect on the public
good: BT downloading
1. Each additional contribution has a declining effect on the public
good: EU
1. First a problem of overcoming start-up costs, then
heightened mobilization, then declining marginal payoffs: 垃圾分类
Partially caused by the pyschological utility curve: people worry more about losing what they have than gaining more.

1. Network Solution

Scholz, John T., Ramiro Berardo, and Brad Kile. 2008. “Do Networks Solve Collective Action Problems? Credibility, Search, and Collaboration.” *The Journal of Politics* 70(2): 393–406.

Social capital: Credibility solves the collective action

Cooperation

+ Activists: Seeking for central positions and more connections
+ Resource users: Embedding in smaller, denser networks.

## Definition

> 狭义上理解的集体行动与集体行为(collective behavior)相接近,是相对于组织行动而言的组织外非集团 行动。奥尔森等人经济政治学分析框架中的集体行动的概念界定当属此类。然而,本研究所指的集体行动则与以上界定相区别, .magenta[既非指社会冲突意义上的群体行为,亦非特指非制度化的组织外行为,而是更广泛意义上利益相关者所采取的一致行为的过程]。 (魏娜, 张小进 2010: 13)

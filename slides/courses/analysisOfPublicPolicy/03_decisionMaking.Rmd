## Decision Making Models

### Rational-Choice Based

+ Bounded Rational-Choice Model

### Irrational Model

+ Bureaucratic Organization

## Classic Rational-Choice Model

Goal : Utility = Earning - Cost

Being rational means being a .magenta[utility maximizer].

### How the Decision is Made?

*Rational choice model* says: 

Earning > Cost 

???

The same logic is applied to policy decisions, such as whether to promote a new welfare package, constructing a dam, and so on.

Therefore, Herbert Simon said...

## Bounded Rationality

Goal : ~~Utility~~ Satisficing (Satisfy + Suffice)

--

Why?

+ Lack of information
+ Cognitive Limitation
+ Time constraint

???

e.g., decision making in drug safety, inventory control(存货管理), system modeling, game strategy

Cognitive Limitation: difficulty to evaluate data

## Simon's Decision Making Model

Step 1: Intelligence Phase: Problem identification

???
collective information, formulating the situation

--

Step 2: Design Phase: Developing alternatives

--

Step 3: Choice Phase: Choosing the option

## Irrational Models

Rationality is just a conjecture of economists.<sup>&midast;</sup>

## Bureaucratic Organization Model

.center[<img src="images/cubanMissile.webp" height = 350 />]

???

October 16–28, 1962, Soviet ballistic missile deployment in Cuba

In response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961 and the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion.

Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence 

After several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached. Publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed that it would dismantle all US-built Jupiter MRBMs, which had been deployed in Turkey against the Soviet Union; there has been debate on whether or not Italy was included in the agreement as well.

When all offensive missiles and Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended on November 21, 1962. The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between Washington and Moscow. As a result, the Moscow–Washington hotline was established. A series of agreements later reduced US–Soviet tensions for several years until both parties began to build their nuclear arsenal even further.


Bureaucrats and related agencies have their own outlook, values and assessment 

Organizational structure and bureaucracy are deciding factors

## Muddling, Muddling

> We must think of (space activities) as part of a continuing process…and not as a series of separate leaps, each requiring a massive concentration of energy...Space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities.

NASA "promised" in the Space Shuttle (1972)

+ Ferry astronauts to a large earth orbiting space station (original goal)
+ Provide a "space truck" for commercial payloads, some bound for geosynchronous orbit
+ Deliver military reconnaissance satellites
+ Transport space station modules
+ Provide an orbital laboratory for science experiments
+ Repair and return satellites
+ Transport civilians (“anyone can fly”)
+ Increase reliability
+ Cut the cost of space flight by a “factor of ten”
+ Be reusable
+ Fly 24 to 50 times per year

## Where the Policy Ended

> The increased complexity of a Shuttle designed to be all things to all people created inherently greater risks than if more realistic technical goals had been set at the start...The greatest compromise NASA made was...with the premise of the vehicle itself.

A collection of problems, understandings of causes, symbols, solutions, and other elements of public problems that come to the attention of members of the public and their governmental officials.

boundaries of the system agenda represents the limit of legitimate jurisdiction of existing governmental authority---changing over time

.right-column[<img src="images/appalachian.jpg" height = 480 />]

???

e.g., of the third face: Appalachian coal miners. The mining company remains dominant and the miners cannot conceive of a situation. When the miners show some signs of rebelling, the dominant interests are able to ignore pressure for change. In the long run, people may stop fighting as they become and remain alienated from politics; quiescence is the result.

.right-column[<img src="images/zhujun.jfif" width = 320 /> Appealing to higher level]

???

1. Going public with a problem by using symbols and images to induce greater media and public sympathy for their cause.
1. Groups that lose in the first stage of a political conflict appealing to higher decision-making level, such as when losing parties appeal to state and then federal institutions for an opportunity to be heard, hoping that in the process they will attract others who agree with them and their cause

Johnson's "Great Society" program

1960 Lyndon Johnson (after JFK) administration’s Great Society program, which contained a package of policies that sought to attack poverty, poor health, racial discrimination, and urban decline, among other problems. This package of programs was made possible by an aggressively activist president and a large Democratic majority in the Congress

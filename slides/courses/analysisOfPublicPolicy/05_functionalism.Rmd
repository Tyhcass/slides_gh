# Structural Functionalism

???

---

## Overview

1. Origin
1. Components
1. Logic
1. Dynamics
1. Criticism
1. Alternative view (rational choice)

---

## Origin

+ Biology
+ Sociology
+ Anthropology
+ Political Science (public administration)

???

Sociology: Emile [ei'mi:l] Durkheim [ˈdɜːkhaɪm], 涂尔干

---

### Classic in policy analysis

+ Popular since 1960s
    + Political development in newly independent countries 

???

The approaches for the U.S. and European politics didn't work for new countries

## Object

Functions of a structure in a system

--

Design vs. .magenta[Reality]

???

what does a structure (guerrilla movement, political party, election, etc.) do within the political system (of country x)? 

---

## Components

.huge[1 System]

???

1. The connection of structures
1. Conversion process, basic pattern maintenance, and various capabilities (distributive, symbolic, etc.)
1. Developing countries have a simpler system, and developed have a complex one, but both have structures with SIMILAR functions.

--

.center[.Large[&rarr; 2 Structures]]

???

political party, legislature, executive, judiciary, interest group, officials

--


.right-column[
&rarr;3 Function
+ Input
+ Output
]

???

1. Economic terms
1. Input: political socialization & recruitment, interest articulation/aggregation, and political communication
1. Output: rule-making, rule implementation/adjudication
1. Different structures may perform others' function: executive has legislature functions (部门立法)

---

.Huge[4 Environment]

+ International

--

+ Domestic (culture)
    + Elite  
    (e.g., expansive, exclusive, closed, parochial, synthetic, null)
    + Elite-mass interactions

???

Pye: China  
Weinter: mass demands and elites' strategies

---

## Focus

Consequences &larr; Actors' importance &larr; Actors' functions & performances

--

System &harr; actors

---

## Recall: System Theory

.center[<img src="images/politicalSystem.png" height = 500 />]

---

background-image: url("images/structuralFunctionalism.png")
background-position: center
background-size: contain

## Logic

---

## Political Development

1. Penetration (elites &rarr; masses)
1. Commitment (elites &larr; masses)
1. Participation (elites &harr; masses)
1. Distribution (elites &rarr; masses)

???

Penetration: Whether political elites can get what they want from people over whom they seek to exercise power (Joseph LaPalombara, poli sci Yale)

--

(Interaction w. environments)

---

## Change

*Inevitable*

+ ~~State~~ Political system: Openness

--

+ Challenges from the environments  
&rarr; adaptions and adjustment

--

+ Stability bias &rarr; Conservative, evolutionary changes

---

## Motivations

Elites and their associates

Social groups 

System's own demands

---

## Criticisms

What are issues do you find?

--

1. Concept stretching: e.g., system, interactions

???
From anthropology.  
Giovanni Satori, David Collier

--

1. Actor exclusion

???
Only a mere number of structures

--

1. Normative bias

???
Pro-capitalism

--

1. "A theory about social wholes as social wholes"?

# Structural Functionalism in Practice

---

## Operationalizing Structural Functionalism

A microanalytic, individualistic perspective

--

1. Actors
1. Goal
1. Interests
1. Interaction

---

class: middle

> .large[Where rational choice theory wants to simplify, the microversion of structural-functionalism calls for enrichment.  
---Lane (1994: 466)]

---

## Actors

The actors are .magenta[groups]: 

1. Elites
1. Masses
1. Governments

---

class: middle

.large[*Does individuals enter the picture?*]

???
as leaders 

---

## Goals 

Actors have .magenta[fixed] preference orders and move .magenta[strategically] to .magenta[maximize] their *interests*.

--

Social equilbiria?

--

Changes, developments, and all sorts of politics

---

## Interests?

Economics: Utility function  
Poli sci/sociologist: Non-universal, narrow, monetary

Structural-functionalism: political culture

???

Pye: Elites behave differently in different countries and circumstances

民主党（Union, LGBTQ, environmentalists） vs. 共和党

---

## Political Model

I. Each actor evaluates goals and opportunities &rarr; conform/fight

???
conform: following the existing rule

--

II. Game
+ All actor conform &rarr; system stable
+ Fighter vs. conformer &rarr; fighter wins
+ Fighter vs. fighter &rarr; "Stronger" wins

--

III. Winners rerule the system

--

IV. The process repeats in the new system.

---

## Contribution of the SF

Bring the variety and variance in:

1. Varieties of the institutions, leaders, social configurations
1. Variances in space and time

---

## Taking-Home Points

1. Structural functionalism
    + Environment
    + System
    + Structure
1. Actor as groups
    + Elites
    + Masses
    + Government
    + Interests
    + Function

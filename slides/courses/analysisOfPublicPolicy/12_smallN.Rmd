## Overview

1. What's a small-N (interpretive) approach?
1. What can it do?
1. How can you tell a small-N based research is good?
1. How different it is from LNA?

# Small-N Approach (SNA)

---

## How Small Is Small?

One, a couple, or several...hundreds

???

hundreds of documents

--

Don't forget some large-N analyses (LNA) also focus on one, a pair, or several hundreds.

---

## Why Small?

.left-column[

### Hey, LNA guys...

+ Emotional distance? 
+ Context?
+ Value (of researchers)?
]

--

.right-column[

.small[What does Monk Tang mean?]
<img src="images/chaPing.jpg" />

]

???

The real world is very complex, dude~

---

## What Can SNA Do?

1. Value judging
1. Story telling
1. Narrative analysis
1. Dramaturgical analysis
1. Category analysis

---

### Value Judging

.left-column[
+ Identifying "communities of meaning"
+ Studying the framing and interactions among the communities
]

.right-column[
<img src="images/essenceOfDecision.jpg" />
]

???

Graham Tillett Allison Jr. , American political scientist and professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard

---

### Story Telling

Telling stories about a certain group or policy based on archives and interviews.

--

### Narrative Analysis

Going beyond telling a story  
Using story to .magenta[make an argument]  
Putting an argument in the .magenta[thick context]

---

### Dramaturgical Analysis

How do policy and policy makers "act"?

.left-column[
+ "Actors"
+ "Content"
+ "Theme"
+ "Space"
]

--

.right-column[
<img src="images/theoVanGogh.jpg" />
]

???

Dutch film actor Theo van Gogh was assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim wo ojbected to the director's movie Submission that critcized the treatment of women in Islam.

---

### Category Analysis

+ Identity: Welfare recipients, official language...

--

+ Levels: Comprehensive strategic partners, strategic and cooperative partners, strategic partners, constructive cooperative partners...

???
Strüver, Georg. 2017. “China’s Partnership Diplomacy: International Alignment Based on Interests or Ideology.” The Chinese Journal of International Politics 10(1): 31–65.

--

+ Direction: Smart city, service-oriented government, neo-urbanization...

---

## Speciality of SNA Researchers (vs. LNA Researchers)

+ Role
+ Data collection
+ Analysis

---

### Role

1. Researchers are human
    + Experiences
    + Cognitive differences
    
???

Cognitive differences: men and women; allowing tourists entering the campus

--

1. Researchers have value

--

1. Researchers participate
    + Observer vs. Insider
    + Undercover vs. Activist

???

Researchers generalize/create culture, etc.

---

### Data Collection

Observing .magenta[with intention to understand];

???

1. Pader, Ellen-J. 1994. “Spatial Relations and Housing Policy: Regulations That Discriminate Against Mexican-Origin Households.” Journal of Planning Education and Research 13(2): 119–35.

Using American view of occupancy (and thus housing policy enforcement) is discriminated.

--

Interviewing with respondents as .magenta[conversational partner];  

???
2. Schaffer, Frederic Charles. 2000. Democracy in Translation: Understanding Politics in an Unfamiliar Culture. Cornell University Press.

Interview of people in Senegal about democracy and American democracy

--

Reading the documents as they were writing .magenta[meaningfully].

???

3. Chock, Phyllis Pease. 1995. “Ambiguity in Policy Discourse: Congressional Talk about Immigration.” Policy Sciences 28(2): 165–84.

By examining the written record of spoken language, she was able to analyze the ways in which legislators’ and expert witnesses’ embedded ideas about immigrants reflected and shaped immigration reform and policy contentions.

---

### Analysis

"No need to transform words into numbers"

+ Numbers are not the results but the sources

--

+ More details than digits

???

Narrative reports often read like novels.

--

+ Where did the number or whatever data come from?

--

+ Where to find the data, what are data, how to know what are saying in the data?...

???

Analysis and collection are intertwined.

---

## Evaluating SNA

.left-column[

~~Be objective~~

Reality is universal;
Policy is not constructed.

In large N, implications are clear at least.

]

--

.right-column[

~~Be voiceless~~

<img src="images/Beauvoir.jpg" height = 350 />

]

???

Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, gender is constructed.

One is not born a woman, but becomes one.

---

.left-column[

~~Be experimental~~

The SNA assumes impacts and multicausality are data and useful.

]

--

.right-column[
~~Be replicated~~

<img src="images/twins.gif" height = 300 />

]

---

~~Be generalized~~

.center[<img src="images/yangQihan.jpg" height = 500 />]

---

## A Different Paradigm

Philosophically, epistemologically, and ideologically

+ Perfect validity is impossible
+ The society is constructed
+ Data do not talk, researchers do


???

researchers interpret data
researchers generalize conclusions

---

## Novel Evaluation System

+ Credibility
+ Transferability
+ Dependability
+ Confirmability

---

### Credibility

.center[<img src="images/zhiLuWeiMa.png" height = 400 />]

???

If the data and implications are presented credibly.

Based on enough description

---

### Transferability

> 当年的SARS也属于冠状病毒，公众容易将二者相类比。当年在应对SARS的过程中，我们是有过教训的。这就提醒我们，千万不可产生轻敌心态和麻痹思想，更不能犯下和当年一样的错误。  
---"尽快掐灭疫情传播的'火种'"《人民日报客户端》（2020-01-22）

--

Readers' call, though.

???

a result of detailed, illustrative description, and the responsibility shifts from the researcher (the sender) to individuals in other settings (the receivers)

https://wap.peopleapp.com/article/5060699/4954813

---

### Dependability

Legit process of inquiry

+ What kinds of data, what period of time? 
+ Over a determined period of time, or simply one visit and a few interviews?  
...

---

### Confirmability

Findings clearly linked to analysis, data, and the research site.

.center[<img src="images/rumor.jpg" height = 400 />]

???

There's an alternative set of criteria which is more philosophical,

## SNA vs. LNA

| LNA           | SNA           |
|---------------|---------------|
| Objective     | Understanding |
| Voiceless     | Voice         |
| Experimental  | Comparison    |
| Replicable    | Depth         |
| Generalizable | Context       |

Always care about the framing and understanding an issue from different angles.

???

+ Understanding: the researchers' background, view, approach, and value; 钟南山更可信
+ Voice: Study by Bourgois and Schonberg (2009) of homeless men and women who were addicted to drugs is compelling because it showed they care.
+ Comparison: reflexivity: Well-crafted studies provide the reader an opportunity to reflect on his or own situations in regard to similarities and differences.
+ Depth: richesness for understanding and context differences
+ Context: not only if policy works, but what cases not and why

---

## Take-Home Points

SNA is a different world

.left-column[
### Different goals
+ Credibility
+ Transferability
+ Dependability
+ Confirmability
    ]
    
.right-column[
### Different criteria
+ Understanding
+ Voice
+ Comparison
+ Depth
+ Context

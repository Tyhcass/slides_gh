.Huge[Why?]

???
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the US:

"A program that prepares individuals to serve as managers in the executive arm of local, state, and federal government and that focuses on the systematic study of executive organization and management."

Incorporate with organization theories, law management, bureacrat, budget analyses, etc.

## What IS This Course About?

Long long time ago, like in 1927,...

.center[<img src="images/TaftHutchins.png" height = 400 />]

???

## Chief Justice vs. Chancellor of the School

1927, Yale

[Taft:] “Well, I understand that at Yale you teach your students that judges are fools.”

### Indicators

1. Academic reputation .small[(respondents from 83,000 academics)]
1. Employer reputation .small[(42,000 responses from graduate employers worldwide)]
1. Research citations per paper
1. H-index .small[(the most cited papers and the number of citations that they have received in other publications)]

--

Weighted results

???

Weight: based on area, e.g. publication rates are very high, research citations and the h-index account for 25% of each university’s total score.

Scientific? 


Most dominant paradigm is positivism
Paradigm: a distinct set of concepts or thought patterns, including theories, research methods, postulates, and standards for what constitutes legitimate contributions to a field

---

## Positivist Paradigm

+ Positivist: 
    + *Data*-based
    + Problem solving through systematic, scientific queries

???
实证主义
Re-imported from the French word positivisme(/positee vish men/), derived from positif in its sense of 'imposed on the mind by experience'. 

--

+ Post-positivist
    + *Culture*-based (norms, morality, values)
    + Normative, ethical process


???

Compara the U.S. and China, Talk about approach, content, and instructors

## Approach

| Approach         | China | U.S. |
|------------------|-------|------|
| Outsider         | 55%   |      |
| Limited insider  | 15%   | 75%  |
| In-depth insider | 30%   | 25%  |
.small[Source: He et al 2016, Table 4]


???

positivist vs. non-positivist

[1] Solely of public policy theories.  
[2] Positivist framework and analysis based on welfare economics.  
[3] Strong analytical orientation


---

## Content

### China

Public policy theories, policy environments, and policy processes

--

### U.S.

Welfare economics, rational modeling, utilities

## Instructors

# Being Scientific! Well...

Why do we need being scientific

## A Story

Somehow in the Internet, there a rumor that a Doc in traditional medicine told a [story](http://szyyj.gd.gov.cn/zyyfw/ysbj/content/post_2541293.html) about drinking water. 

---

> 每天早晨喝一杯凉水，是一个错误的养生做法……[医生]他是偶然发现这个问题的，当时他在给一位女士调理身体，本来调理得很好……突然有一天，再诊脉的时候，发现她的舌质又淡白了，舌体胖大，病情反复，忙问这是怎么回事儿？她回答，半个月前，看到电视里面有养生专家让晨起喝凉水，于是坚持了这些天，已经腹泻了很多次了。这么样，损失了阳气，导致水湿重。有位中医也被这一说法骗了……最后竟然收集了几百例的病例，都是晨起喝凉水，导致的各种复杂古怪的病症的。

*Theory*

*Conclusion*

What does the "scientific" even mean?

## Why Being Scientific?

Data alone is not enough~ 

1. Where to find data?
1. How data are legit?
1. How to make sense of data?

--

Conducting credible analyses

Assumption + Theory &rarr; Method + Data &rarr; Conclusion

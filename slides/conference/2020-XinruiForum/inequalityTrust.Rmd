???

+ whether citizens perceive inequality correctly
+ consider it a priority or respond to inequality at all

a reason of the above is the democracy---political trust is regarded as democratic supports, but inequality is also severe in others

## Goal

1. Political trust in general
    + Case of China

???

1. Prominent authoritarian state
1. One of the most unequal countries in the world in terms of income and wealth distribution

1. Research of mechanisms
    + Social conflict
    + Governance inequality
    + Judicial injustice
    + Corruption
    
???

Conflict theory: Inequality reduces social capital, generates distrust and social conflicts, then make governance difficult.
Relative power theory: Inequality reduce social conflicts, John Galbraith 1983, third face of power, but also lower trust

Governance inequality: unequal distribution of resources in society leads to unequal influences in politics, biased governance

judicial justice: the last resort for citizens 

Corruption

Uslaner (2011) illustrated that economic inequality leads to high levels of corruption and low levels of service delivery, which then reduces trust in government

## Gini Coefficient

\begin{equation}
G = 1 - \sum(q_i + q_{i - 1})(p_i - p_{i - 1}) 
\end{equation}

where `q` is the cumulative proportion of SES of prefecture `i`; `p` is cumulative proportion of population within the prefecture. 
The resulted coefficients ranges from 0.16 to 0.25.
